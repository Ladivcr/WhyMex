I'm using a virtual enviroment (.whymexEnv) 
so, please check the libraries that I using. 

Don't try to install one by one because when I 
installed Django (pip install django -U) some
libraries were install.

Some commands that I did before to start to work are: 
    pip install django -U 
    pip install folium

NOTE: Create your own virtual enviroment
